                  Cameroonian authorities are taking several measures to boost stadium occupancy rates at the ongoing African Cup of Nations the country is hosting. <br>
                  In the West, elites, and officials are hard at work to make sure fans are going to stadiums to watch matches,<br>
                  especially Day 2 matches of group B this Friday, January 14 at the Kouekong Stadium in Bafoussam. <br> 
                  On Thursday, January 13, Awa Fonka Augustine, Governor of the Western region, urged heads of the public service <br>
                  parastatal and private entities in his administrative district to allow their staff to go home by noon so that they can go to stadiums <br>
                  to watch the Senegal-Guinea and Malawi-Zimbabwe matches scheduled respectively at 14h and 17h <br>
